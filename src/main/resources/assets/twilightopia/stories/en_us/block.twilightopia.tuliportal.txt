§5Dream • §1Twilightopia
Here where you stand,
Land covered with twilight.
No sunlight up above,
Only the moon shining bright.
Deep in the woods,
Sprites dance in light.
Down in the valleys,
Trees observe in quiet.
Bells in their leaves,
Flicker when they
[NXTPG]
hear the battle cry.
Take care, brave explorer,
And may you have a good night.
